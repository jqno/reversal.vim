# Vim-RNB, a Vim colorscheme template

## What is this thing?

RNB is a template designed to help vimmers create their own colorschemes without much effort.

In reality, Vim colorschemes are not that hard to write but there are several benefits to using a template such as RNB:

* you can define/modify variables once instead of messing around with potentially botched substitutions,
* you can distribute a lean colorscheme, free from unnecessary logic,
* you can distribute the source alongside the colorscheme, making it easy for your users to experiment and adapt *your* colorscheme to *their* needs,
* you can focus on the design of your colorscheme rather than its implementation,
* you can start working on new colorscheme ideas very easily.

## What do I need to use it?

[ERB](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/index.html), the templating engine used here, is part of Ruby's standard library so you will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) to generate your colorscheme. Neither ERB nor Ruby knowledge is required, though.

## How do I use it?

The process is divided in five steps:

1. rename `colors/rnb.erb` to `colors/name_of_your_colorscheme.erb`,
2. start by editing your colorscheme's information,
3. define your colors,
4. define your highlight groups and links,
5. and generate your colorscheme.

Steps 2 to 5 are thoroughly described in the colorscheme template itself in an effort to make it portable: if you ever decide to distribute your colorscheme you can simply package the template with it.
